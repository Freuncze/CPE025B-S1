    <h2>Skyrim</h2>
    <p>The original home of Men in Tamriel, Skyrim is located in the frigid north of Tamriel, between Morrowind and High Rock, and is the home of the oldest race of men, the Nords. Skyrim is a rugged, harsh, and unforgiving place of snow-capped, jagged mountains and wind-blasted ice fields standing in contrast to the verdant forests of the Rift and Falkreath Hold.</p>

    <h2>Cyrodiil</h2>
    <p>Cyrodiil is the home of one of the four races of Men: the Imperials. It is located in the heart of the continent. It serves as the capital of the many Empires since the First Era. Cyrodiil is covered largely by forests in the interior; humid marshes south of the Lower Niben; vineyards and farmsteads surrounding County Skingrad; the rolling amber hills of the Gold Coast to the west; and jagged highlands and tundra of the Jerall and Valus Mountains to the north and east.</p>
    <p>Racism level = <strong>99.42%</strong></p>
